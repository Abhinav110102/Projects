    <!--Fourth section-->

      <h1>How To Use The App</h1>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 20px;">
        A user will first need to log into or register an account with RXpress. Once they do that 
        they will be taken to the home page of the app. Here they can see their profile picture, name, prescriptions,
        a weekly calendar to know what day it is, and reminders for their prescriptions. Users are able to navigate
        to any of our other screens (Prescription, Drug Interactions, Calendar, FAQ, and Settings) using the menu at the 
        top left of the screen.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 20px;">
        Users can access their, and their dependent's, medications using the Prescription screen. On this screen the user
        is able to add dependents by using the (+) button at the bottom and putting in the name of the dependent.
        The user is able to access their, and their dependent's, medications by clicking on either a dependent's name or 'Your Prescriptions'. 
        Once they click on either their or their dependent's prescriptions they will see a list of the medications added under that person.
        To add prescriptions the user will select the (+) at the bottom of the screen and click on the next (+) option that comes up.
        The user will then fill out the form in order to add the prescription. In order to edit or delete an already added prescription the user
        will click on one of the prescriptions on their screen and select either edit or delete at the bottom of the screen. To delete a dependent
        the user will click on the (+) at the bottom of the dependent's prescription screen and select the trash icon.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 20px;">
        Users can also look up if any medications severely interact by navigating to the Drug Interactions screen. On this screen
        a user will type in the search bar at the top of the screen the name of the medication that they want to find the interactions of
        and they select the search icon. If there are any severe interactions with the medication they typed in it will show those interactions.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 20px;">
        Users are also able to access a built in calendar by navigating to the Calendar screen. On this screen users are able to see the times to take
        their prescriptions (automatically populated when you put a prescription in). A user can also see the details of their prescriptions by clicking on 
        the button that has the prescription name they want to look at. Users are also able to add their own events by clicking on the (+) at the bottom of the 
        screen on the date that they want to set the event on. The user will then fill out the form to add the event to the calendar. In order to edit or delete an 
        already added event the user will click on the event on the main calendar screen and select either edit or delete at the bottom of the screen.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 20px;">
        If a user has a question about using the app they can navigate to the FAQ screen on the app. On this screen they will see several questions that they can 
        scroll through to see if it is the same question that they have. If they find the question that they have in the already made list they can click on the 
        question which will then drop down the answer. In these answers there may also be links (the links are blue) that can take the user to the screen they are looking
        for the answer to. If a user does not see their question on the already populated list they can send a question to RXpress by typing in their question into the 
        text box at the bottom of the screen and selecting send. When the user selects send they will potentially be asked which mailing service they would like to use to
        send the email to us.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 20px;">
        Users are able to sign out of their account or view their profile if they navigate to the Settings screen on the app. Once they do this they can either click on
        the profile button or the sign out button. If the user clicks on the sign out button they will be taken back to the log in screen for the app. If the user selects the profile
        button they will be able to view their profile information.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 20px;">
        Users are able to edit their profile picture by going to the Profile screen and clicking on the purple camera button that is next to the profile picture. When the user clicks 
        the camera button they will have the option to select a picture. Users can also edit their profile information by selecting the edit profile button.
